## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts: data mining and synthetic data generation. The goal is to create a robust pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data using LinkedIn profiles and advanced language models.

## Data Mining

The first part of the project involves data mining by scraping LinkedIn profiles using Selenium and applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on screenshots. This innovative scraping technique allows us to gather detailed profile information efficiently.

## Synthetic Data Generation

The second part focuses on creating a model to generate high-quality synthetic data. We utilize chained Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the data is both realistic and diverse. This approach leverages the power of LLMs to produce synthetic data that closely mimics real-world data.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moogrocker/synthesizer.git
   cd synthesizer
