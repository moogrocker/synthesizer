# Synthesizer - Research Project

An advanced research project focused on generating **high-quality synthetic data** through innovative **data mining** techniques and **advanced modelling**.

## Project Overview

This Research Project is composed of two main components: data mining and synthetic data generation. The data mining phase involves scraping LinkedIn profiles using Selenium and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to gather detailed profile information efficiently. The synthetic data generation phase employs chained Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce realistic and heterogene synthetic data.

## 1 - Data Mining

The first part of the project involves data mining by scraping LinkedIn profiles using Selenium and applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on screenshots. This innovative scraping technique allows us to gather detailed profile information efficiently.

## 2 - Synthetic Data Generation

The second part focuses on creating a model to generate high-quality synthetic data. We utilize chained Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the data is both realistic and diverse. This approach leverages the power of LLMs to produce synthetic data that closely mimics real-world data.


## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moogrocker/synthesizer.git
   cd synthesizer

2. **Install dependencies**:
